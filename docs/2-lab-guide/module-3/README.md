# Module 3 - Data Science with SparkML and Azure Machine Learning services

In module 3 we'll use SparkML and Azure Machine Learning services to train a model and deploy it as a REST API.

We'll additionally look at how to set up Batch scoring using Azure Machine Learning services Pipelines.

## Standalone Module Instructions

In order to run this module seperately, you can set the `module_3_only` flag in [99-Shared-Functions-and-Settings](../../../code/03-Data-Science/pyspark/99-Shared-Functions-and-Settings.py) to `True`

## Module Setup

After loading the DBC file into your workspace, you must edit [99-Shared-Functions-and-Settings](../../../code/03-Data-Science/pyspark/99-Shared-Functions-and-Settings.py) to update username and Azure Machine Learning workspace settings.
